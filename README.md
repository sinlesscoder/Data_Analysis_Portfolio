# Portfolio Projects

For this project, I worked on a dataset of video game sales found on kaggle, where I graph the trend of different element of video games over the range of time period. I wanted to do this particular project because I love games myself, and was interested to see how was the game like from 1980s and how the trend changed overtime.
